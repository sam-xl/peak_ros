# peak_ros
ROS2 driver for use with PEAK MicroPulse devices.

## Installation

### ROS Workspace
This package depends on tf2-sensor-msgs.

```bash
cd ros2_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/sam-xl/peak_ros.git
rosdep install --from-paths peak_ros --ignore-src
cd ..
colcon build
```

## Usage

```bash
ros2 launch peak_ros capture.launch
```

Call either of the services `/peak/take_single_measurement` or `/peak/stream_data`.

```bash
ros2 service call /peak/take_single_measurement peak_ros/srv/TakeSingleMeasurement "take_single_measurement: true"
```

...or...

```bash
ros2 service call /peak/stream_data peak_ros/srv/StreamData "stream_data: true"
```

After this RViz ought to show the current b scan as a pointcloud on `/peak/b_scan`.

If you set appropriate gate parameters in the [config file](src/peak_ros/config/default.yaml) you ought to get a gated b scan as another pointcloud on `/peak/gated_b_scan`, which will depict the front wall, if enabled, and the backwall or any defects.

### Reconstructions in A Fixed External Frame with TF
The [reconstruction configuration parameters](https://github.com/MShields1986/peak_ros/blob/c82a4a9ae57a0f5440fdc98597124bc062844d97/src/peak_ros/config/default.yaml#L43-L47) allow for live reconstruction of the gated ultrasound observations in an external fixed frame.

Furthermore the [export_pcd launch arguement](https://github.com/MShields1986/peak_ros/blob/c82a4a9ae57a0f5440fdc98597124bc062844d97/src/peak_ros/launch/init.launch#L12) allows for the export of the reconstruction to a PCD file for further processing and visualisation in other tools such as [CloudCompare](https://www.danielgm.net/cc/).

### Using Custom MPS files
Currently this driver required MPS files to contain the following directives in order to correctly parse data:
    1. DOF - Needed to determine the resolution and size of the returned data (currently only 1 and 4 are supported)
    2. GATS - Needed to determine the length of each a scan
    3. SWP - Needed to determine the number of focal laws (Note, that only a single sweep is currently supported)

Please ensure that your MPS file contains only one of each of these directives and that it accurately reflects what you are trying to achieve. MPS files ought to be placed in the `src/peak_ros/mps` and then modifiy the [launch file](src/peak_ros/launch/init.launch) `mps_file` launch arguement.

### Streaming Rates
Streaming rates can be set in the [config file](src/peak_ros/config/default.yaml). However, please be aware that your mps file will dictate the upper bound for your streaming rate as the number of focal laws and listening time for each focal law, GATS command, dictates the acquisition time needed by the Peak hardware.
